# How to build a project
```
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
```
<!-- ## **Make sure that you have already installed Bison and Flex!** -->

<!-- ## Compiler settings:
```
  $ g++ -Wall -Wextra -O2

# Some words about the algorithm
### The task requires to output the numbers of intersected triangles recieved from stdin. To do it faster then with naive implementation with O(n^2) we use octree to divide space into 8 parts. Then we find intersections between triangles in the same part or between triangles lied in the several parts at the same time. 
---
## Steps of implementation:
* Input triangles from **stdin**
* Build the octree dependent on the maximum absolute value of a coordinate of one of triangle
* Check the intersection of one-part triangles and triangles lied in the same branch of the tree
* Return the result

# Algorithmic efficiency
## In the worst way (when almost all the triangles lies nearby each other) we have O(n^2). In case of uniform distribution of triangles in space this is asymptotically O(NlogN)

## 9216 the same triangles:

## 9216 almost uniform distributed triangles (it's wrong assumption, but ok :)):

## All in all, it is better than the naive implementation
